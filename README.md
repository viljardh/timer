# Timer

Prototype for shooting timer. Initially for dry fire, hopefully live down the line. 

Needs a bit of testing for components. 

## Features: 
- Random draw timer
- Random draw timer with adjustable time to complete task
- Shot timer - Random draw, tracks amount of shots and splits
- Split overview

## Working on: 
- Test levels for microphone
- Instant vs delayed
- Reaction time 
- Menu overhaul
- Dry/live mode

## Down the line: 
- Send splits via bluetooth to phone app
- Connect phone to DB backend
- Store splits on stick

## Thoughts on the todos
Since the only user this is intended for and being tested on is me, I'm allowing myself a few shortcuts which would make it harder to use for someone else without significant instructions. However down the line I'd love to make it more user-friendly so I can perhaps make it as a fun gift to friends (and make it more house-friendly as the beep on a real deal timer is **really** loud. 

I might get rid of a button down the line. I don't really want the potmeter there, but as it stands it's a really effective way of saving bits and buttons. 

I don't own a proper timer, so I still ask friends who do for input on what a timer needs. Funnily enough, the comment I get the most often is that they want **less** stuff on it. Bluetooth often insisted on. I do have the pins for it, but not sure I have the bits. Time will tell.
